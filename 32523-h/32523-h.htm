<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>The sixty-nine Cautionary Stories that follow have been chosen from five
books by Mrs. Elizabeth Turner, written for the pleasure and instruction
of our little grandparents and great-grandparents. The books are <i>The
Daisy</i>, <i>The Cowslip</i>, <i>The Crocus</i>, <i>The Pink</i> and <i>Short Poems</i>.
Between the years 1810 and 1850 they were on the shelves of most
nurseries, although now they are rarely to be met with. There was also
<i>The Rose</i>, but from that nothing has been taken for these pages, nor
are the original pictures again offered. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>Except for these pictures, a
frequent change of title, and a few trifling alterations for grammar's
sake, the pieces selected are now printed exactly as at first.</p>

<p>Mrs. Turner's belief, as stated by Master Robert in the verses called
"Books better than Toys" in <i>The Pink</i>, was that the children of her
day, when they had money to spend and wanted a real treat, could not
choose anything more suitable than her Cautionary Stories. The piece
runs:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'My dear, as Robert is so good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll give him what I said I would,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two shillings for himself to spend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knows the shop of our good friend.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Yes, I know well the pretty shop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where folks, you know, so often stop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To view the prints. The windows&mdash;look!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are filled with toys and many a book.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'They have a thousand books and toys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For little girls and little boys;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At toys, indeed, I love to <i>look</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I prefer to <i>buy</i> a book.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'These two bright shillings, I suppose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will buy <i>The Cowslip</i> and <i>The Rose</i>;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when two more I get, I think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll buy <i>The Daisy</i> and <i>The Pink</i>.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>In our own time Robert's opinion is not very widely shared: most of us
would not care to give up a cannon or a doll in order that we might be
cautioned; but Mrs. Turner is not the less an entertaining author
because her volumes have fewer attractions for us than some of the
things in a Christmas bazaar. She told her tales with such spirit: her
verses are so straightforward, the rhymes come so pat at the end of the
lines, and you may beat time with your foot and never be put out.</p>

<p>In another piece, "Kitty's Favourites," Mrs. Turner wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The stories Kitty likes so well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often asks her aunt to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are all about good girls and boys.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Kitty's taste, like Robert's, is no longer general. The common view is
that stories about bad children are more fun; and therefore I think you
will be amused by these pages. Whether or not punishment always did
follow the offences as surely and swiftly as Mrs. Turner declares, I am
not prepared to say. If you are in any doubt you had better ask your
parents.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;As a matter of fact, a train of gunpowder does not make a
terrible noise; it makes hardly any noise at all&mdash;a mere <i>pfff!</i> and
though John, Sam Bushy, and Dick White are shown to have been hurt as

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The Westminster Gazette.</i>&mdash;"Very delightful stories they
are. The great difficulty with books for children is that
they are often so large, a difficulty which in the case of
the bound annual really assumes formidable
proportions&mdash;especially to the uncle or aunt who is seized
by the juvenile press-gang and coerced into reading aloud.
But this 'Dumpy Book' is quite perfect from that point of
view, for it is no bigger than a prayer-book. All three
tales are capital fun, and admirably suited to children....
We have unreserved praise for this child's book, dainty and
attractive in what it contains and in the way in which it is
produced."</p></div>

<p>PREFACE (<span class="smcap">Addressed to Children</span>)</p>

<p>Unless you are very keenly set upon reading to yourself, I think I
should advise you to ask some one to read these pieces aloud, not too
many at a time. And I want you to understand that there is a kind of
poetry that is finer far than anything here: poetry to which this book
is, in the old-fashioned phrase, simply a "stepping-stone." When you
feel, as I hope some day you will feel, that these pages no longer
satisfy, then you must turn to the better thing.</p>
